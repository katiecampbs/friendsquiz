# Friends Quiz

Friends Quiz is a responsive quiz for lovers of the tv show, "Friends". It is designed for die hard fans to test their knowledge with a set of interactive multiple choice questions, using Javascript. At the end of the quiz, the user is provided with a score out of ten, and has the option to retake the quiz. The site is intended to be used for trivia, for the users enjoyment.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future there is potential to add levels to the quiz, so once the initial ten questions are answered, the user has the option to proceed onto level 2, and work through another set of questions. This would keep the user on the page longer, and even encourage them to revisit the page again another time. The questions could be updated regularly to increase the challenge.
